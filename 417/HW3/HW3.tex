\section{LFD Problem 3.19}
\begin{tlist}{4}
	\item[(a)] Firstly, the transformation should better be an injection in this case. Secondely, $N$ is to large to get this method return in a reasonable time.
	\item[(b)] I think this method is fine, no obvious problem.
	\item[(c)] This method is a variant of the second one.
\end{tlist}
\section{LFD Exercise 4.5}
\begin{tlist}{4}
  \item[(a)] $\Gamma = I$.
  \item[(b)] It should be a matix, and the fist column of $\Gamma$ should be 1.
\end{tlist}
\section{LFD Problem 4.8}
Firstly, we have $$\nabla E_{aug}(w)=\nabla E_{in}(w)+2\lambda w$$ So we should updata the weight as $$w(t+1)=w(t)-\mu\nabla E_{aug}(w(t))=(1-2\mu\lambda)w(t)-\mu\nabla E_{in}(w(t))$$.
