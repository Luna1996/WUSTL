\maketitle
My first intuition for this question is ABSOLUTE FALSE. Since many language can only distinct certain amont groups of strings. And the sequence presented in the question is an infinity sequence (I assume. But even it's not infinity, I think it's still false). For example, consider a \code{L} only accept string ends with \code{a}, and the sequence goes like \code{a,b,aa,ab,aaa,aab,aaaa,aaab,...}. There is no way it's pair-wise L-distinguishable.
